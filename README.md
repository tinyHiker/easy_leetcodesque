# Python Exercises - Toronto Metropolitan University

## Overview

These exercises are a collection from my first year at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson). The exercises provided an essential platform to test and improve my foundational knowledge of Python programming. They cover a vast array of topics ranging from recursion to Python's built-in modules.

## Topics Covered

1. **Tail Recursion**: Understanding and implementing functions that call themselves as their last action.
2. **Non-Tail Recursion**: Implementing recursive functions where the function's recursive call isn't the last action performed.
3. **Conditional Logic**: Making use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
4. **String Manipulation**: Operations and techniques to modify, slice, and transform strings.
5. **Looping**: Implementing and controlling loops using `for` and `while`.
6. **Sequences**: Working with lists, tuples, and other sequence types.
7. **Unittesting**: Writing and running tests to ensure code behaves as expected.
8. **Python Built-ins Module**: Leveraging the utility functions and classes available in Python's `builtins` module.
9. **List Comprehensions**: Crafting concise and readable ways to create lists.
10. **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Constructing dictionaries in a similar concise manner as list comprehensions.
11. **Raising Errors**: Generating custom exceptions and understanding when and how to raise them.
12. **Module Level `__name__` Variable**: Grasping the importance and usage of the `__name__` variable, especially in scripts and modules.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to Toronto Metropolitan University for providing these exercises. They have been instrumental in solidifying my grasp on Python programming during my formative stages.
